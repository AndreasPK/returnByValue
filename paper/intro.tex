The introduction sets the stage of the paper.
We want to provide a high-level view of the work, the way you would explain it to someone in person over a few minutes.
This way, if they only read the introduction, they will have a good idea about what the paper is about.

* Laziness is great!
* Making things strict which are evaluated anyway is free.
* But it's not free!
* What are the costs.
* How we avoid them (novel work!)
